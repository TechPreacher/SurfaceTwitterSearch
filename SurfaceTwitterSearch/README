SurfaceTwitterSerach is a simple Twitter Search Client for Microsoft Surface 2.0, demonstrating the capabilities of the Microsoft Surface 2.0 SDK.
To display the search GUI, you have to place the Byte Tag specified in Settings.xml on the Surface unit running the application.
You can print your own Byte Tags by downloading them from: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11029
You can also use the Surface Simulator on any computer to simulate placing a Byte Tag on the running application.
